# 🧠 Symptom Solver — NLP-Based Disease Diagnosis System

The **Symptom Solver** is an AI-powered platform that predicts diseases based on user-reported symptoms using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.

It provides an intuitive interface to deliver:
- Accurate disease predictions
- Preventive measures
- Natural treatment suggestions

- 🩺 **NLP-based symptom understanding**
- 📋 **Disease prediction using trained models**
- 💡 **Preventive and natural remedies**
- 🌐 **User-friendly web interface**
- ⚡ **Instant AI-powered health feedback**

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) / spaCy**
- **scikit-learn / Transformers**
- **Pandas, NumPy**

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Users enter symptoms in natural language (e.g., "I have fever and headache").
2. NLP processes and extracts key symptoms.
3. ML model matches symptoms to probable diseases.
4. The system returns:
   - Disease prediction
   - Precautions
   - Natural treatment options
